🎯 GUESS THE NUMBER — C++ Console Game
⚡ "I built this as my very first C++ mini-game, but treated it like a real-world project."
✅ Beginner-level logic, Pro-level attention to detail.

## 🚀 What It Is:

This is a terminal-based guessing game where the user must guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 — but with a twist:

- You only get 7 attempts
- The game reacts differently when you're very close 🔥
- It warns you when you're about to run out of attempts ⏳
- Every input gives smart feedback to keep you hooked!

## 🧾 How to Run This:
🔧 Requirements:

Any C++ compiler (g++, clang++, etc.)

## 💡 Why I Made This (As a Freshman)

I didn’t want to just copy-paste code from YouTube.  
I wanted to build something simple, but make it feel **complete**, **interactive**, and actually **fun** to use.

This project reflects:
- 🔍 My attention to even the smallest details — I take basic ideas seriously.
- 🧠 My focus on both **logic** and **user experience**, even in beginner projects.
- 🚀 My commitment to building and shipping polished projects — in just my **first month of college**.

I believe even the simplest projects can stand out if they're done thoughtfully. This is my take on that.
